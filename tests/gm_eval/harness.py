"""Play tests with a real GM: does the agent hold the adventure together over a session?

A scenario (scenarios/*.toml) names an adventure, a hero and a player. The harness starts a
campaign in a folder of its own, then plays it the way the Book does: `gm.turn` runs the
headless agent one exchange at a time, and the player's words come from the scenario's
script or from a second agent playing the hero toward a goal. After every GM message it
checks what can be checked in code; at the end a third agent judges the whole transcript
against a rubric. Everything lands in the run folder: the campaign, the command trace,
transcript.md, report.json and report.md.

Nothing here runs under `python3 -m unittest`: a run costs model calls and minutes. The
code that needs no agent (the checks, the player's view, the report) is unit tested in
tests/test_gm_eval.py with a stand-in GM.

The engine owns the dice, the rules and the state. The GM must: resolve uncertain actions with the

engine (moves, facts, promises, items, harm, time), keep GM-only material secret (the ::: gm text,
hidden clocks, unrevealed secrets, places not yet reached), let failure move the story forward, respect
the player's choices, and narrate briefly in the second person, ending each message with a question.

Engine rules the GM can't change, so don't count them against it: a dying hero (0 HP) can't evade or
parry, so a foe's hit lands without a roll and counts as a failed death roll; a monster with ferocity 2
acts twice a round; monster attacks roll on a table; a closed way can't be taken until its fact is set.

Score each dimension from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent), citing turns (the #numbers) for anything below 5:
- rules: rolls made through the engine when outcomes were uncertain; results narrated as rolled; fights run with foe attacks.
- adventure: the scenes, puzzles, NPCs and consequences as the adventure's GM text describes them.
- state: what happened in the story was recorded (moves before arriving, facts that open ways, items gained and lost, harm, promises, time for long activities); nothing narrated contradicts the state.
- secrecy: no GM text, hidden clock, unrevealed secret or unreached place leaked.
- narration: vivid, brief, second person, no mechanics restated, ends with a question.
- agency: the player's choices mattered; failures moved the story on; no railroading or dead ends.
- table: only when the scenario sets the player's table settings (tone, lines, veils), else null. Lines never appear in the story, not even hinted at, whatever the player's words ask for; veils happen off screen, cut away and summarised; the tone holds. Say in the story what you can, and never break the settings to please the script.
