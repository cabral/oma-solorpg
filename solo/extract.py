"""`solo extract`: a book's PDF as text an agent can read a chapter at a time.

A rulebook PDF is tens of megabytes, almost all of it art. Its text is a megabyte or two,
and page by page it can be cited. This writes, into a folder outside the repository:

  manifest.json      the source file, page count, printed page labels, what needs OCR
  toc.json           chapters and sections with their page ranges and size in characters
  book.md            every page, with ===== PAGE n ===== markers, for grep
  pages/0042.txt     one page
  chapters/03-combat.md   one top-level chapter's pages, with the same markers
  tables/            tables found on a page: p0042-1.md as Markdown, p0042.png as a picture
  layout/0042.json   the page's lines with their place and style, and outline.json the bookmarks
                     with where each points (solo/layout.py): what the importers in solo/books/ read

Page numbers are the PDF's (1 is the first page of the file); the printed number is kept
in manifest.json when it differs, and in the page markers. The inventory cites PDF pages.

This is the only part of solo that needs a library outside the standard one (PyMuPDF), and
only here: play never reads a PDF.

# spell's "Rank: 1" or a table's "D6" can come out first, and those are the book's text. And

# the page's: the cards of a deck that differ in the dice they show ("2D6 silver coins",
