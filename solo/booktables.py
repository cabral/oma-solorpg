"""A book's roll table, from its text into a pack's tables/<id>.toml.

Copying a table by hand is where an import goes wrong quietly: a range typed 4-5 for 4-6,
a row dropped at a page break, a result half-remembered. This reads the table the way
`solo extract` found it (a Markdown grid, tables/p0042-1.md) or as roll lines taken from a
page ("1-2 Frozen in place"), works out the dice from the header or the ranges, and writes
the table the engine reads. `solo validate` then checks the ranges cover every roll, and
`solo audit` that every result is on the page the inventory cites.
