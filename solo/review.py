"""`solo review`: the checks a play test runs, over a campaign played for real.

`tests/gm_eval` plays scenarios with a real GM and checks each message and the campaign's state in
code. The same checks apply to a campaign someone actually played, offline and at no cost: this
module holds them, and the harness imports them. What they find in real play is what a scenario
should be written about.

Every check is a function returning findings, (kind, detail) pairs.
