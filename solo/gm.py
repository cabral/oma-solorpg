"""The GM behind the Book: the player's default agent, run headless one turn at a time.

The Book (the plugin's story window) never talks to a model. It runs `solo gm turn` in
the background and watches `.solo/turn.json`, which this module rewrites as the agent
works: its status, the narration as it streams in, and a word about what it is doing
(reading the table, rolling, writing it down). When the turn ends, the narration is
recorded with the rest of the conversation (`said` events), so the campaign still keeps
the transcript and any agent session can be thrown away.

Only agents with a headless mode that streams JSON and resumes a session are driven
here: Claude Code and Codex. Any other default agent keeps its terminal window
(`solo play --terminal`); the Book still shows the story as it is recorded.

This is the only part of solo that runs an agent. The engine still never calls a model.
