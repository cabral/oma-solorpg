"""`solo report`: what a bug report needs about a campaign, safe to post in a public issue.

An issue is public, and a campaign is built from books the player owns: rules pages, table
results, scene text and monster tables are the publisher's. So the report shows what happened
by ids, numbers and dice only. Every free-text field of an event (a table's result, an oracle's
answer, a threat's words, a note) is left out, and so are the packs' text and the rules pages.
The last messages of the story are the one exception, since a bug about the GM is a bug about
what it said: the report says to read them before posting, and `--no-messages` leaves them out.
