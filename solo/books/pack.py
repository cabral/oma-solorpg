"""What a recipe builds: a system pack or an adventure pack, held in memory until it is written.

A recipe reads a book's sections (solo/sections.py) and adds to the pack: a file, a section
of system.toml, creation.toml or gear.toml (or, for an adventure, of adventure.toml and its
chapters), and an inventory item saying where the book had it and where it went. `write`
then puts the lot on disk, inventory.toml included, so that `solo audit` can check the pack
against the book's pages the way it checks one an agent wrote.
