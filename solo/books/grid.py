"""A table as rows of cells, read from the lines of a page by where each word sits.

A book sets a table as a header of small bold words and cells under them. The PDF hands
them over as lines: sometimes one cell to a line, sometimes two cells fused ("5 silver
Common"), and a cell that wraps is a second line under the first. This cuts each line into
cells where the words have a gap, puts each cell under the header it belongs to, and starts
a new row where the gap to the line above is a row's height, so a line close under another
only carries the rest of a wrapped cell and is added to the row above.
