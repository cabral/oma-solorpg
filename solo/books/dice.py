"""A roll table, read from where its rows sit: "D6 FIRST NAME" over numbers and what they give.

A book sets a roll table in whatever shape the page allows: a header with the die and what it gives, the
rows under it; the same table in two halves side by side, or a long one continued in the next column;
a number with its text in the same line ("1-2 Warhammer ...") or in a cell of its own; a column of
results that wrap. And a table of several dice, one column each, read together as a sentence
(the quest: "One day, <D4>, the characters come across <D6> ...").

A row is found by its number: the next one of the die, at the start of a line, in a column of numbers;
its words are the text in that column from there to the next number, with what wraps under it.
