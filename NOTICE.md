## Dragonbane

This game is not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by Fria Ligan AB. This Supplement was created under Fria Ligan AB's Dragonbane Third Party Supplement License.

oma-solorpg is a third-party supplement for Dragonbane (first edition, Fria Ligan AB, 2023), published as a virtual tabletop module under the [Dragonbane Third-Party Tabletop Module License, version 1.1](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/Dragonbane-License-Agreement-version-1.1.pdf). To play Dragonbane it requires the Dragonbane core game; Ironsworn (below) needs no book. It is not a video game.

## What is Free League's

Dragonbane, Drakar och Demoner, the game's terms and the "A Supplement for Dragonbane" logo (`assets/a-supplement-for-dragonbane.png`, unmodified from Free League's logo pack) belong to Fria Ligan AB. This project uses the game's terminology (attribute, skill, condition and kin names), refers to its books by title and page, and uses the logo, as the license allows.

It does not include any of Free League's text, tables, rules or art. The rules the engine runs are built by each player from their own copy of the books (`make rules`) and stay on their machine, in `~/Games/solo`. Nothing built from a Dragonbane book belongs in this repository, and pull requests that add any will be refused.

## Ironsworn

This work is based on Ironsworn, created by Shawn Tomkin, and licensed for our use under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

`packs/ironsworn` holds Ironsworn's moves (35), oracle tables (33) and assets (78), which Shawn Tomkin published under that license. [Datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn) (version 0.0.10) publishes them as data, with the license of each object marked, and `solo import datasworn` converted them into the pack's files. The changes made to them are these: the book's text is kept as written, with each link to another part of the book replaced by the words it linked, bold marked `**like this**`, a table written as TOML (with `then` where a row sends you on to another table), and one file to each move, table and asset, carrying its page in the book and the credit above. The ask-the-oracle tables are not tables here: their odds are the engine's (`[oracle]` in `system.toml`), and the importer prints the numbers they give so a difference shows.

What isn't here: the rest of Ironsworn's text (its NPCs, the atlas, the truths) is licensed CC BY-NC-SA by Tomkin Press, which is for non-commercial use only and asks the same license of anything built from it, so the importer takes only what is marked CC BY and says what it left out. Tomkin Press's images, icons, trade dress and other design elements aren't licensed for use, and this project uses none; it is not an official Tomkin Press or Ironsworn product.

## What is this project's

The engine, the plugin, the skills, The Red Tusk Hall, The Bell Under the Hill (its text and its people are original), the heroes Ragna, Hrafna, Torvald and Eydis, the hero name lists, the text portraits, the `system.toml`, `creation.toml` and pre-made heroes of `packs/ironsworn`, and the made-up test rules in `tests/fixtures` are this project's own, under the MIT License ([LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## Generative AI

The game master is a generative AI: your coding agent writes the story as you play.

Much of this project was written with an AI coding agent, including its code, the text of The Red Tusk Hall and The Bell Under the Hill and the test adventures, the hero names and the text-drawn portraits.
