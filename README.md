# oma-solorpg

A solo virtual tabletop for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). You play a tabletop RPG alone, and your coding agent is the game master.

It is a VTT, not a video game. There are no graphics beyond text: the scene is a page of prose, the map is a list of exits, a fight is drawn in characters, and faces are text portraits. What it gives you is what a VTT gives a table: dice that roll themselves, a character sheet that keeps count, fights with initiative and hit points, clocks and hidden countdowns, an oracle, and a record of everything that happened. The game master is whatever agent Omarchy runs for you (Claude Code or Codex), headless behind a window called the Book.

- `solo` owns the dice, the rules, character creation and the campaign state. It is standard-library Python (3.11+), with no network access and no API keys. The agent brings the model.
- An omarchy-shell plugin is the table: a d20 in the bar, the Book where the story is told, and a Table docked beside it where you start adventures, make heroes, roll, rest and ask the oracle.
- It plays Ironsworn out of the box: the game's free rules ship in this repository, with credit (see [Ironsworn](#ironsworn) below), so a fresh install plays with no book. It also plays Dragonbane, from your own copy of the books, which aren't in this repository (see [Dragonbane](#dragonbane)); `make dragonbane` builds it from your PDFs.

> **Generative AI.** The game master is a generative AI: your agent writes the story as you play. Much of this project was also written with an AI coding agent, including its code, the text of The Red Tusk Hall, the hero names and the text-drawn art.

## Quick start

You need Omarchy, `make`, Python 3.11+ and your agent (`claude` or `codex`).

```bash
git clone <this repository> ~/Code/oma-solorpg && cd ~/Code/oma-solorpg
make install                                              # links solo, the GM skills and the plugin, and enables it
```

Then click the d20 in the bar, choose New adventure, pick **The Bell Under the Hill** and Begin. That is Ironsworn, and it needs nothing else: no book, no import.

Dragonbane needs your own PDFs. Point `make dragonbane` at a folder of them and it builds every pack it has an importer for, in about twenty seconds and without an agent:

```bash
uv pip install --system pymupdf                           # only the import reads PDFs
make dragonbane BOOKS=~/Books/Dragonbane                  # a folder of your PDFs (or one PDF)
make check                                                # audits each pack against its book
```

It reads each book's bookmarks and layout, writes your private packs into `~/Games/solo/systems/` and audits every one against the book's own pages. For the core rules that is everything the engine runs (the numbers of every roll and fight, the weapons and armor, all the gear, the tables, character creation, the bestiary, the heroic abilities, the spells), plus a rules page for each section of the book that has words of its own. The same goes for the Book of Magic (its schools, spells, tricks and recipes), the three card decks (treasure, improvised weapons, adventure hooks) and the solo booklet (the fortune chart, the inspiration table, the threat counter, the exploration tables). The importers are deterministic: the same PDFs give the same packs, and anything an importer had to decide it says in a note. Nothing of a book is in this repository (the importers hold where things are and how to read them; the words come from your PDF each time), and nothing they write lands in this folder.

A book no importer knows (another printing, an adventure) is read by your agent instead: `make rules BOOK=<pdf>` and `make supplement ID=<id> BOOK=<pdf>` start that, and `make adventure` does it for an adventure, with the `solo-rules-import` and `solo-import` skills. `make dragonbane` says which of your PDFs it left for them. Then the Dragonbane adventures you import show up on the same New adventure screen.

If you already have packs an agent wrote from the same books, `solo import book` won't overwrite them: build the new ones beside them (`--systems ~/Games/solo/new`) and `solo compare ~/Games/solo/new/dragonbane-rulebook ~/Games/solo/systems/dragonbane-rulebook` shows, area by area, what differs, before you decide which to keep.

`make` alone lists every target. `AGENT=codex make rules ...` picks the agent for the ones that use one; the default is Omarchy's default agent.

## Play

With clicks only:

1. Click the d20 in the bar. The table opens on the right.
2. New adventure: pick an adventure (The Bell Under the Hill plays Ironsworn with nothing else installed; The Red Tusk Hall plays on the Dragonbane rules you built from your book), then a hero: a pre-made one, or Random, with any kin, profession and age you want to lock in Dragonbane. Reroll until you like the sheet; type a name if you want one. Optionally set the tone and your lines and veils: things that never happen in the story, and things that happen only off screen. The GM reads them every session.
3. Begin adventure. The Book opens beside the table, the scene's name decrypts across the page, and the GM writes the opening.
4. Write to the GM at the bottom of the Book. Its answer streams in as it is written. On the table, click a skill or attribute to roll it (set boons and banes first), push a failed roll, rest, light a torch, or ask the oracle. The GM sees all of it in the log. In Ironsworn the table has moves instead of skills: click a move (and the stat it rolls, and any adds), burn momentum on a roll it could save, start a vow, mark progress on it, and make its progress roll.
5. In Dragonbane, when the GM starts a fight, the Book draws it as a still scene (you, the foes in initiative order, the last blow between you) and the table shows your weapons. Pick a foe and click a weapon to attack; when a foe hits you, choose Evade, Parry or Take it. A Dragon on your roll waits for what it does (double the blow, a free attack on another foe, pierce armor) in a card of its own. A hero with spells has them under Magic: set a power level, click a spell that is ready to cast it (the foe you picked takes the damage), prepare another from the Grimoire, or cast it from there. The abilities that go with a blow, a parry, a rest or a new round are switched on first and paid for with the roll; the others are one click and the GM reads their page. A weapon that is damaged or broken says so on its button, with Mend (a roll) and Artisan (none) in Gear, where the load shows too. At 0 HP you're dying and Death roll is the only button left.

Right-click the d20 to open the Book again. The Campaigns button lists every game with its hero and scene, so resuming is one click. Delete on a card removes a campaign you've abandoned, folder and all, after a second click to confirm (`solo delete <dir>` from a terminal).

Close the Book whenever you like. The campaign records the conversation word for word, so it opens again exactly where you stopped. `omarchy-shell shell toggle cabral.oma-solorpg` is worth a keybinding.

From a terminal instead:

```bash
solo new red-tusk                                          # random hero, folder under ~/Games/solo/campaigns
solo new red-tusk --character "dwarf fighter" --name Brokk # lock some choices
solo new red-tusk --character ragna --play                 # the pre-made hero, and open the GM
solo new red-tusk --character ~/Games/solo/campaigns/red-tusk-ragna  # a living hero from an earlier campaign, rested
solo character elf mage --seed 7                           # just look at a hero (JSON)
```

## The Book

- Every roll stops the page for a moment: a d20 tumbles, slows and lands. A Dragon glows gold, a Demon shakes red. Rolls you make on the table and rolls the GM makes look the same.
- Your hero's skills speak up. Scenes list what a skill might notice; entering rolls each one quietly, and only a success appears, in the margin, like `SPOT HIDDEN [5] SUCCESS`. You never learn what you missed. The GM can raise one too.
- Your hero's portrait is drawn in text from their kin and profession, and it follows the story: angry, scared, dazed, wounded, dying, dead. A Dragon earns a grin.
- A torch burns down with game time. Dark places are dark.
- The codex (top right) keeps the people you've met, with a face each, and blanks out what they want, fear and hide until you find out.
- Omens from hidden countdowns reach you as omens, never as numbers.
- When your hero dies, the Book closes on a gravestone with your last words, and Home keeps them in the Hall of the Fallen.

The GM runs headless: `solo gm turn` drives Claude Code or Codex one turn at a time and streams what it writes. GM pace, under the table's settings, sets how long it thinks before it answers: Quick answers sooner and spends fewer tokens, Careful thinks longer about the rules. It is the agent's effort level (low, medium or high), one pace for every campaign (`solo gm pace`). Other agents open in a terminal (Terminal on the table, or `solo play --terminal`), and the Book still shows the story as it is recorded.

## The desktop joins in

While a game is on, Omarchy plays along. A Dragon flashes your window borders gold and floods the screen with gold light; a Demon turns the borders red, drains the colour and tears the picture at its edges; a blow jolts the screen. These land when the Book's dice do. While your hero is dying the borders stay dark red and a red rim closes round the screen, further with every failed death roll; when they die the screen goes grey and cold for a while and a bell tolls. Omens ripple the screen and arrive as notifications. The table has sounds, all made on the spot the first time they're needed: dice that rattle and land in time with the Book's, a chime for a Dragon, a growl for a Demon, a war drum when a fight starts, a torch catching, a page turning when the GM speaks. The screen warms like candlelight while the Book is open, and the screensaver shows your hero instead of the logo. The bar's d20 lights up when the GM is waiting for you, pulses while you're dying and turns into a skull when you die.

Each of these puts back exactly what it changed (your border colours, your own screen shader, your screen temperature, your screensaver text), and each can be switched off under Desktop effects on the table.

## How a turn works

```
player text
 -> agent picks one intent from what `solo scene` offers
 -> solo check sneaking               dice and rules, in code
 -> agent reads the scene, proposes the consequence
 -> solo commit '{"facts": ...}'      validated, logged, clocks advance
 -> agent narrates what was committed
```

In a game of moves (Ironsworn) the loop is the same and the first step is the move: `solo act face_danger --stat iron` rolls it and comes back with the book's words for the result, and the agent commits what they give or cost (`momentum +1`, `health -1`) and keeps vows and fights as `solo track`s.

Questions nobody rolls for go down a fixed ladder: first the adventure text, then a skill check, then the oracle (`solo ask`), which takes its odds from the tracked state. The agent never picks the answer. The full protocol is in [skills/solo-gm/SKILL.md](skills/solo-gm/SKILL.md).

Without a solo rules book, the oracle is the engine's own: a likelihood oracle that brings its own surprises. Some answers come with a random event tied to the people and threads in play, and entering a scene can find it altered or interrupted, as often as a chaos factor (1 to 9) says. With Dragonbane's solo rules built into your pack, the oracle is the book's own chart (below).

Fights, dying and advancement are rules in the system pack, run by the engine: initiative cards, weapon damage through armor, death rolls at 0 HP, and skills marked by Dragons and Demons and rolled up at the end of a session.

## A long campaign

A campaign can run for many sessions, and the GM may start any of them knowing nothing: the agent's session can be lost, compacted or replaced at any time. The campaign remembers for it.

- What the hero does comes back. The GM writes down what will follow from a deed (the guard who took the bribe will brag, the cultist who fled will warn his master, the debt at the inn falls due in two days), and the engine tells it when the moment comes: the next time you walk into the hall, meet the guard, or when the time has passed. You only see the world react.
- People remember what you did to them, and word spreads to their kin. Someone the GM made up keeps their name, face, voice and wants from one session to the next.
- A place you return to is the place you left: the forced gate still hangs open, and the GM is told how long you were away.
- Before it brings anything back, the GM searches everything ever said at the table (`solo recall`), so a name it gave you three sessions ago stays the same name.
- A fresh session reads the story so far from the log, even if the GM never wrote a recap, and is reminded to write one every dozen messages.
- A hero who lives through an adventure brings their story into the next one (`solo new <adventure> --character <folder>`): how it ended, what was left open, who will remember them, and what you told the GM about them (a lost sister, an oath).

## Ironsworn

Ironsworn is written for solo play, and its moves, oracles and assets are published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. Unlike Dragonbane's, they can ship with this project: `packs/ironsworn` is a whole game, and a fresh install plays it with no book. The starter adventure, The Bell Under the Hill, is this project's own: a hamlet, a road, a barrow and an oath, for one hero and one sitting, with a vow, a journey, a bond and a fight in it.

- **The action roll**: an action die and a stat (and any adds) against two challenge dice. Beat both for a strong hit, one for a weak hit, neither for a miss; challenge dice that match are a twist. `solo act <move> --stat <stat>`, or click the move on the table. The GM gets the move's own words for the result and decides what it gives or costs.
- **Momentum** runs from -6 to +10. After a roll it can be burned (`solo burn`, or the button beside the roll): the challenge dice under it are cancelled, and it falls back to its reset. Each impact (wounded, shaken, unprepared and the rest) lowers its ceiling and its reset by one.
- **Progress tracks** measure vows, journeys, fights and bonds: ten boxes of four ticks, marked by rank and read by a progress roll when the hero ends the challenge (`solo track`). The table draws them as boxes.
- **The oracle** is a d100 with odds from small chance to almost certain, and a double is a twist; the book's tables for names, places, settlements, turning points and Pay the Price are `solo table`.
- **Where it comes from**: the moves, tables and assets are converted from [Datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn)'s copy of the rulebook by `solo import datasworn`, each with its page and its credit. The rest of the book's text (its NPCs, atlas and truths) is under CC BY-NC-SA, which is for non-commercial use only and asks the same license of anything built from it; it isn't here, and the game doesn't need it. [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) has the credit and the details.

## Dragonbane

oma-solorpg is a third-party supplement for Dragonbane, published as a virtual tabletop module under Free League's [Dragonbane Third-Party Tabletop Module License](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/community-content/free-tabletop-licenses/). You need the Dragonbane core game to play it.

The license lets a supplement use Dragonbane's terminology and refer to its pages, and it does not let a supplement carry a copy of the rules. So this repository ships the words and none of the rules:

- `packs/dragonbane` holds the game's names (attributes, conditions, skills, what HP and WP are called), a list of hero names per kin, and the text portraits. Its `needs` list says what a campaign can't start without, and the engine refuses to start one on Dragonbane until your own packs supply it.
- The numbers, tables and procedures come from your books. `make dragonbane` builds them into `~/Games/solo/systems/dragonbane-rulebook` (the core rules), a pack for each further book laid over it (the Book of Magic, the card decks) and `~/Games/solo/systems/dragonbane` on top of them (the solo rules), each listed under the `extends` of the one above. Campaigns use the top one.
- The Red Tusk Hall and Ragna are this project's own, written for Dragonbane.
- The tests run on made-up rules (`tests/fixtures/house`) in the same shapes, so they need no book either.

With the solo rules built, the engine runs Dragonbane alone the way Alone in Deepfall Breach does: a hero with an extra heroic ability, the fortune chart and its inspiration words for the questions a GM would answer, effects for a Dragon or a Demon outside a fight, threats that close in while you delay, searching and scavenging, simple NPCs with attacker roles, healing and rallying alone, and the core set's treasure deck if you type in your cards. On the table these are the oracle's columns, Tend my wounds at a rest, Sole Survivor beside the push buttons, and Rally and Save yourself beside the death roll. `solo rule fortune` (or threats, searching, healing alone) shows each rule as the engine runs it.

## Your own content

Your adventures, your packs and your campaigns live in `~/Games/solo` (set `SOLO_HOME` to move it), outside this folder:

```
~/Games/solo/systems/<id>/      rules packs built from books you own (make dragonbane)
~/Games/solo/adventures/<id>/   adventures you imported or generated; they show up on the New adventure screen
~/Games/solo/sources/<id>/      your books as text, page by page (solo extract)
~/Games/solo/campaigns/<id>/    created by New adventure or solo new
```

An adventure from a PDF you own, or from a Foundry VTT export:

```bash
make adventure ID=my-adventure PDF=~/Books/dragonbane-adventures.pdf
make adventure ID=my-adventure FOUNDRY=~/Exports/my-adventure    # Foundry's Export Data JSON, or fvtt package unpack output
make check-adventure ID=my-adventure
```

From a PDF, `make adventure` extracts the book, starts the pack's inventory and opens your agent with the `solo-import` skill; from Foundry it imports the journals, actors and tables first and asks the agent to add what the text only implies: factions, clocks, gates, branches, NPC profiles and voices. `make check-adventure` validates the pack, prints its outline (spoilers) and audits it against the book. The skill also says how to turn a published adventure's table rules (timers, replacement characters, scoring) into solo ones.

A campaign nobody has written yet, from a premise you pitch:

```bash
make campaign ID=salt-and-ash TONE=grim MISSIONS=4 \
  PREMISE="a smuggler's coast where the dead keep the lighthouses"
make campaign-next CAMPAIGN=~/Games/solo/campaigns/salt-and-ash-ragna   # after each mission
```

`make campaign` rolls the campaign's bones first: a hub to come back to (a safe place), the people who oppose you and a hidden clock for their plan, with omens, and the first mission as a path of three waypoints to its heart. The dice decide what each waypoint holds (a way to get through, someone on the road, a fight, a find, a place that fights back, signs of the enemy), who is there and what they want, from your system pack's own tables where it has them: the solo rules' threats, the treasure deck, the simple NPCs and the bestiary, the inspiration words. Every roll goes into the pack's `rolls.toml`, and what it decided cites it. Then your agent writes the campaign up with the `solo-campaign` skill, keeping to what the dice said, and `make check-adventure ID=salt-and-ash` checks it: it validates, and every roll is used or explained. Until then it's a draft and stays off the New adventure screen.

Missions after the first are written as you play. Once a session closes a mission, `make campaign-next` rolls the next one into the same pack, and rolls which of the things your hero did come back in it: a consequence left open, a promise, someone who remembers you, someone who got away, what word reached a faction. Someone the GM made up in play gets a file of their own, with the name and face you met. The new mission reaches your campaign when the agent has written it; until then the hub tells the GM the next chapter is on its way.

Everything `make` runs is a `solo` command you can run yourself, one step at a time:

```bash
solo extract ~/Books/dragonbane-core.pdf --out ~/Games/solo/sources/dragonbane-rulebook
solo inventory ~/Games/solo/systems/dragonbane-rulebook --extract ~/Games/solo/sources/dragonbane-rulebook
solo import table ~/Games/solo/sources/dragonbane-rulebook/tables/p0045-1.md --out ~/Games/solo/systems/dragonbane-rulebook/tables/fear.toml
solo audit --system ~/Games/solo/systems/dragonbane-rulebook
solo import foundry adventure <export> --out ~/Games/solo/adventures/my-adventure
solo import foundry character <character.json> --out ~/Games/solo/ragna.json
solo validate --adventure my-adventure
solo outline --adventure my-adventure
solo campaign new salt-and-ash --premise "..." --tone grim --missions 4 [--seed 7]
solo campaign roll salt-and-ash treasure --for "what the keeper hides"
solo campaign check salt-and-ash
solo campaign next ~/Games/solo/campaigns/salt-and-ash-ragna
```

How a book becomes a pack, what the formats hold, and what went wrong on earlier imports: [docs/INGESTION.md](docs/INGESTION.md) and [docs/PACK_FORMAT.md](docs/PACK_FORMAT.md). The design is in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md), and what comes next in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Don't publish packs built from books you bought. They stay in `~/Games/solo`, which is outside this repository for that reason.

## Development

Pull requests are welcome: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the one rule (nothing from a book goes in the repository), how to run the checks and how to write a GM scenario. Every pull request runs the tests on Python 3.11 and the newest release.

```bash
make test
```

The mechanics families are `d20-under` (Dragonbane), `d6-pool` (a Year Zero Engine style dice pool, tested with a placeholder pack) and `action-roll` (Ironsworn: an action die and a stat against two challenge dice, momentum and progress tracks). A new game on an existing family is a `system.toml`, not code; its creation tables are a `creation.toml` and its pre-made heroes go in `characters/`. Fights, death rolls and advancement are optional sections of `system.toml` (`[combat]`, `[weapons]`, `[armor]`, `[dying]`, `[advancement]`). Foe attacks by skill roll are d20-under only for now; any family can use monster attack tables.

The tests play on `tests/fixtures/house`, a made-up rules pack laid over the bundled names the way your book's pack is in play. `tests/test_playtest.py` plays The Red Tusk Hall from the road to the end with fixed dice, and `tests/test_long_campaign.py` carries a hero into a second adventure. Ironsworn's rules are in the repository, so its tests play on the pack itself: `tests/test_action_roll.py` covers the engine, and `tests/test_starter_adventure.py` plays The Bell Under the Hill with fixed dice, a vow, a journey, a bond and a fight included.

Whether the GM holds an adventure together is a different question, and `tests/gm_eval` asks it with a real agent, on the rules you built: scenarios play a part of The Red Tusk Hall (or all of it, with a second agent as the player) through `solo gm turn`, check every message and the campaign state in code, and have a third agent judge the transcript. See [tests/gm_eval/README.md](tests/gm_eval/README.md).

```bash
python3 tests/gm_eval/run.py red-tusk-opening   # a few minutes and real model calls
```

The QML can be checked without an Omarchy desktop, with PySide6 (`pip install PySide6-Essentials`):

```bash
make qml-check                              # Panel.qml and BarWidget.qml loaded with stand-ins for Quickshell, screenshots included
python3 tests/qml/render.py /tmp/book       # the Book, rendered against real engine state, as PNGs
```

The website is in `site/`, plain HTML with no build step: `make site` serves it locally, and `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes it to GitHub Pages. [site/README.md](site/README.md) says where the trailers go and where its screenshots come from.
